# TCP/IP packet encoder based on Raspberry Pi Pico W + W5500-EVB-Pico

* Raspberry Pi Pico W for serving a device configuration web page
* W5500-EVB-Pico from Wiznet for TCP/IP relay

## Sponsorship from PCBWay

* [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) kindly provided PCB of this device. This is my first time using the company's service.
* My honest impression is that their service is **well-streamlined with web-based ordering process** with good support of **instant chat assistance**. I could quickly make my order on the comprehensive web page.
* It took about a week to receive the assembled PCB at home in Korea. It was good to see that **each PCB was separately packaged**. The quality of the final product was excellent.
* I want to thank PCBWay again for their support. Highly recommend PCBWay. Try their excellent service at https://www.pcbway.com/ .
