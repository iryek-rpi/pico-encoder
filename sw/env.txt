* backup package list for conda
```
conda list -e > requirements.txt
```
* recreate the environment
```
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
```

* backup package list for pip
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
* recreate the environment 
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  * When I tested this, the packages weren't identical across the outputs (pip included fewer packages) but it was sufficient to set up a functional environment.

* For those getting odd path references in requirements.txt, use:
```
pip list --format=freeze > requirements.tx
```
